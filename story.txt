My friend has a really nice BMW and we went for a beautiful drive downtown. 
We could smell fresh brot as we were driving. 
I went to the Baeckerei and ordered a chocolate cake for my friends birthday.
I could feel the sun beaming on my lederhose. 
We stopped in Berlin to watch a Bayern Munich game.
There is a sweet little Hund playing in an alleyway.
We said hi to the hund and fed it some bratwurst.
